Title: Modeling Counts of Responses over Time Spans in a Census Operation

A major component of survey and census operations is the elicitation of
responses from a population of interest. Modes of contact can involve mailings,
the internet, phone calls, and in-person visits. Outreach efforts for the U.S.
Decennial Census seek to improve participation by communicating the importance
of responding and how the data are used. For planners of an operation and its
associated outreach, it may be of interest to characterize trends in responses
over the span of an operation. This work considers panel count models to
capture effects of outreach and other covariates, and anticipate future
response totals with appropriate measures of uncertainty. Panel models are used
in biostatistics to characterize counts of recurrent events within a subject
which occur between observation times; here, geographic regions or other
segments of the population are regarded as subjects. Of particular interest is
the Mobile Questionnaire Assistance (MQA) outreach operation established in the
2020 Census. A number of MQA events were held nationally during the census
where staff engaged with community members on location. Objectives of the work
include expressing a region's exposure to MQA using proximity in space and
time, and considering whether there is a significant association between this
exposure and response rate in the data.

Title: Modeling Counts of Responses over a Span of Time

Survey and census operations typically involve gathering data by reaching out
to a population of interest to elicit responses. Contact attempts and response
methods can involve mailings, the internet, phone calls, and in-person visits
by field representatives. Alternative data sources such as administrative
records and adjustments for missingness may be considered for those who do not
respond; however, respondent data are usually preferred with alternatives
regarded as mitigations. It may be of interest to study the evolution of
response counts over the span of an operation, to capture effects of associated
covariates, and to anticipate future counts with appropriate measures of
uncertainty. This work considers the use of panel count models for this
purpose. Panel models are used in biostatistics to characterize counts of
recurrent events within a subject occurring between observation times. The
framework can also be applied in the present setting by regarding geographic
regions or other segments of the population as subjects.

Title: A Model for Projected Response Counts in a Census Operation

Abstract: A national household census enumerates the population of a country by
both geography and demographics of interest. Results of the U.S. Decennial
Census have many important uses, such as determining locations of congressional
seats, allocation of federal funding, and as a baseline to study population and
household characteristics. Therefore, it is important that responses are
recorded from as many households as possible: either by self-response or other
means. Mobile Questionnaire Assistance (MQA) is particular outreach operation
first established in the 2020 U.S. Census. During the census, a number of MQA
events were held throughout the nation where staff engaged with community
members to encourage census participation and assist with the response process.
Using data from the operation, it is of interest to evaluate the relationship
between MQA exposure and response rate. This work explores a panel count
modeling framework to assess the effect of MQA exposure and predict counts in
specific time intervals of a census operation for geographies such as census
tracts. A particular query of interest is the number of responses predicted in
the remainder of the operation, with varying exposure of a community to nearby
MQA events.
